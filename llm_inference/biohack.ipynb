The primary objective was to investigate the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the safety, antitumor activity at the RP2D, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of GDC-0927. The protocol was approved by Institutional Review Boards at participating institutions and written informed consent was obtained from patients prior to performing any procedures. The study was conducted in conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever afforded greater protection to the individual. Patients Postmenopausal women with histologic or cytologic diagnosis of locally assessed ER + /HER2 − adenocarcinoma of the breast, with evidence of metastatic disease or locally recurrent disease not amenable to resection or radiotherapy, with progressive disease after greater than or equal to 6 months of treatment with hormonal therapy, were eligible to enroll. An ER + tumor was defined as staining in ≥1% cells by IHC. HER2 − breast cancer was defined as an IHC result of 0 or 1+ for cellular membrane protein expression, or a FISH result showing HER2/CEP17 ratio of <1.8, or an average of <4 copies of HER2 gene per nucleus for systems without an internal central probe. Inclusion criteria were ≥18 years of age with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 and adequate organ function [absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/μL; platelets ≥100,000/μL; aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or ≤5 × ULN if liver function abnormalities were due to underlying malignancy; total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN regardless of liver involvement secondary to tumor; serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN]. Other inclusion criteria were ≤2 prior chemotherapies in the advanced or metastatic setting, ≥2 months since last use of tamoxifen, ≥6 months since last use of fulvestrant, ≥2 weeks since last use of any other endocrine therapy, and ≥3 weeks since last use of any chemotherapy. The inclusion of patients with increased serum indirect bilirubin (≤3 × ULN) due to Gilbert syndrome was permitted. In the dose-expansion cohorts, eligible patients had measurable disease or evaluable disease. Prior treatment with another oral SERD was not allowed. Other exclusion criteria were: untreated brain metastasis; current treatment with any systemic anticancer therapies or experimental treatments; current use of warfarin, phenytoin, or proton pump inhibitors; diagnosis of any secondary malignancy within prior 2 years except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ ; active inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, or upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery; human immunodeficiency virus infection; clinically significant history of liver disease; major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment; radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to enrollment; any of the following occurrences within 12 months of enrollment—myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of grade ≥2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack; and any other condition deemed inappropriate for study. Study treatments During dose escalation, GDC-0927 was administered orally as a single dose on day −7 for pharmacokinetic evaluation during the lead-in period. Starting on day 1, patients received their treatment once daily. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were evaluated from day −7 through the first cycle (28 days) of treatment, for a total of 35 days. Patients were assigned to escalating doses of GDC-0927 using a standard 3+3 design. The starting dose was 600 mg/day followed by dose escalation in 400 mg increments. An expansion cohort was enrolled at the maximum administered dose (MAD) to further characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of GDC-0927. Dose reductions were not allowed during the DLT assessment window, but were allowed once the dose cohort was closed to further enrollment. Dose delays were allowed during the DLT assessment window and for <28 days in consecutive cycles. Study assessments Toxicity was graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (Version 4.0). A DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AE) deemed by the investigator to be related to the study drug: Any grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity (excluding alopecia of any grade and grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that reversed to grade ≤2 within 24 hours with maximal medical therapy); any grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity lasting >7 days; any grade toxicity leading to study drug interruption lasting >7 days; any case of potential drug-induced liver injury (elevated ALT or AST in combination with either elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's law); treatment-emergent ALT or AST (>3 × baseline value) in combination with total bilirubin (>2 × ULN of which ≥35% is direct bilirubin); treatment-emergent ALT or AST >3 × baseline value in combination with clinical jaundice. Safety was assessed through summaries of AEs, changes in laboratory test results, changes in vital signs, and GDC-0927 exposure; all patients who received study treatment on day 1 of cycle 1 were included in the analyses. A full plasma pharmacokinetic profile was obtained for GDC-0927 and analyzed using noncompartmental methods for all patients in the study. Determination of steady-state trough concentrations (before dosing) of GDC-0927 was performed for all patients in dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts up to cycle 3 day 1. Objective response and clinical benefit rates were derived according to RECIST v1.1. [ 18 F]-fluoroestradiol (FES)–PET imaging was performed at baseline and at cycle 2 day 3 (≥18 hours after dosing) in dose escalation to quantify ER expression in tumors and to assess for pharmacodynamic response. The mean percent change from baseline in SUV Max (corrected for background activity) for up to five index lesions was calculated for each patient as described elsewhere ( 17 ). Disease in the liver and some areas of the GI tract was considered unevaluable in the FES analysis because of confounding normal physiologic uptake of the tracer. Protein levels for ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and Ki67 were measured by IHC in baseline and available on-treatment (cycle 2 or 3, day 8) biopsies. All IHC cases were stained by a single laboratory and scored by a single pathologist to avoid interlaboratory and interobserver variability. Ki67 was scored as percentage of positively stained tumor cells. ER and PR protein levels are represented by Histoscores (H-scores) calculated with a range of 0–300 using the formula: (3 × percentage of positively stained tumor cell nuclei at strong intensity) + (2 × percentage of positively stained tumor cell nuclei at intermediate intensity) + (1 × percentage of positively stained tumor cell nuclei at weak intensity). Gene expression analysis in available matched baseline and on-treatment biopsies was performed using the RNA Access Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) followed by paired-end (2×50b, 50M reads) sequencing on the HiSeq (Illumina). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was analyzed to gain insights into potential causal relationships between the clinical activity of GDC-0927 and resistance mechanisms to prior endocrine therapy. Hotspot mutations in ESR1 , PIK3CA , and AKT1 were analyzed in baseline, on-treatment, and end-of-treatment plasma-derived ctDNA samples using the BEAMing digital PCR assay (Sysmex Inostics, Inc.). ESR1 mutations were defined as nucleotide substitutions that resulted in the following amino acid changes: E380Q, S463P, V534E, P535H, L536H/P/Q/R, Y537C/N/S, and D538G. Similarly defined, AKT1 mutations were limited to E17K, and PIK3CA mutations included C420R, E542K, E545G/K, Q546K, M1043I, and H1047L/R/Y. A subset of 1,400 mg dose plasma samples were analyzed with Foundation Assay for Circulating Tumor DNA (FACT), a next-generation sequencing ctDNA assay (Foundation Medicine) which covers genomic alterations in full exonic coding regions of 62 commonly altered genes. Samples for pharmacokinetic analyses following a single dose of GDC-0927 were collected on lead-in days −7, −6, −5, −4, −3, and on day 1 of cycle 1. Steady-state samples were collected on day 1 of cycle 2. Single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for GDC-0927 were estimated on the basis of concentration data and nominal time. Plasma concentrations were used to perform a noncompartmental pharmacokinetics analysis with the use of Phoenix WinNonlin (version 8.2, Certera). Antitumor activity was defined as objective response and clinical benefit rates derived according to RECIST v1.1 and summarized by dose level and cohort. Separately, the maximal response in patients with measurable disease at any time on study was reported using waterfall plots. Clinical benefit was defined as either (i) patients with confirmed responses [complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)], or (ii) patients with 24-week or longer outcomes of unconfirmed responses (uCR, uPR), stable disease (SD), or non-CR/non-progressive disease (non-CR/PD). Statistical analysis Because of the exploratory nature of this study, no confirmatory inferential analyses were planned, and no imputation for missing data was done. Descriptive statistics (such as means, medians, SDs, and ranges for continuous data and percentages for categorical data) were used to summarize patient characteristics, treatment administration/compliance, safety parameters, pharmacokinetic parameters, antitumor activity endpoints, and exploratory biomarkers. A total of 60 patients were planned for enrollment at the MTD and/or RP2D to provide a more robust safety profile and a sample size for a preliminary assessment of antitumor activity.

      "{'pmcid': 'PMC2383879', 'abstract': None, 'method': \"Methods Early-onset CAD family-based sample (GENECARD) GENECARD is a collaborative study involving six international investigative sites that make up the GENECARD Study Network. The study is coordinated at Duke University. All study participants signed a consent form approved by the responsible institutional review board or local ethics committee. The study design has been previously reported [ 27 ]. Briefly, the initial genome-wide linkage screen within the GENECARD study was composed of 493 affected sibling pairs in 420 families, where at least two siblings met the criteria for early-onset CAD (eoCAD) [ 15 ]. In order to obtain a more genetically homogenous sample, using a priori defined analyses, our eoCAD sample was stratified into acute coronary syndrome (ACS) families. The presence of ACS was defined as diagnosis of myocardial infarction or unstable angina in at least two affected siblings (228 families) [ 15 ]. ACS is a serious manifestation of CAD which includes the subgroup of MI, and is diagnosed by the presence of at least two of the following three signs/symptoms: chest pain typical of CAD, changes on electrocardiogram, and/or positive serum biomarkers for myocardial infarction (MI). Of the 985 affected individuals in the study, 697 met ACS criteria, with 71 individuals with unstable angina only (89% with MI). Given these data, and since MI and ACS represent similar clinical phenotypes, for simplicity we consider the ACS phenotype as primarily a myocardial infarction phenotype. In order to increase the power to detect association in this sample, we included additional individuals from the selected ACS families that were sampled after the initial linkage screen was completed. A total of eight additional parents and 28 additional unaffected siblings were added to the 228 ACS families. Furthermore, two additional families qualified for the ACS phenotype since the original screen and were also included in the analysis. The characteristics of the eoCAD (n = 420) and ACS (n = 230) GENECARD families are summarized in Table 1 .

All participants undergoing catheterization were offered participation in the study and signed informed consent. Medical history and clinical data were collected and stored in the Duke Information System for Cardiovascular Care database maintained at the Duke Clinical Research Institute [ 28 ]. Controls and cases were chosen on the basis of extent of CAD as measured by the CAD index (CADi). CADi is a numerical summary of coronary angiographic data that incorporates the extent and anatomical distribution of coronary disease [ 29 ]. CADi has been shown to be a better predictor of clinical outcome than extent of CAD [ 30 ]. Affected status was determined by the presence of significant CAD defined as a CADi ≥ 32 [ 31 ], as we have used for previous studies [ 22 , 23 ]. For patients older than 55 years of age, a higher CADi threshold (CADi ≥ 74) was used to adjust for the higher baseline extent of CAD in this group. Given the linkage to MI in the GENECARD study, we also selected a subgroup of Caucasian individuals who experienced MI from the overall CATHGEN group, similar to the GENECARD ACS families. MI was defined as documentation of MI in the medical history. Controls were defined as ≥60 years of age, with no CAD as demonstrated by coronary angiography and no documented history of cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, transplant, or interventional or surgical coronary revascularization procedures [ 32 ]. A comparison of clinical characteristics between GENECARD probands and CATHGEN MI cases and unaffected controls is presented in Table 1 . As a replication data set, the CATHGEN sample provides 80% power to detect effect sizes between 1.25 and 1.45, for allele frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. The CATHGEN MI cases were also stratified into a young affected group (CAD AOO ≤ 55), which provides a consistent comparison for the GENECARD family study. Human donor aorta samples and expression Human aorta samples were collected from heart transplant donors as previously described [ 33 ]. DNA and RNA were isolated from each sample. Eighty-eight samples in total were analyzed representing fifty-eight unique samples, as 30 individuals had more than one sample. As harvested tissue was obtained from deceased heart donors, the clinical data associated with these aortas is very limited and consists of age, sex, and race (Table 1 ). Genotyping was performed using Applied Biosystems Taqman allelic discrimination assays and expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip U95Av2 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Expression signal intensity values were log 2 transformed and normalized using quantile normalization. We analyzed cis effects of FAM5C variants on FAM5C expression using the Affymetrix tag 34442_at, representing the 3' end of FAM5C . Because some subjects had multiple samples while others did not, we treated each individual and sample separately. The expression level of the tag was modeled using multiple linear regression including age, sex, race and additive genotype. To account for repeated measures (i.e., multiple sections per subjects) and as a validation, a mixed model as implemented in the SAS PROC MIXED procedure was utilized (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Peak-wide SNP selection The approximate 30 Mb region of linkage on chromosome 1q contains 138 genes (NCBI Build 36 in Ensembl). We used an iterative fine mapping approach that involved selecting SNPs with a minor allele frequency of at least 5% in the Caucasian population spaced at 100 kilobases (kb) [ 34 ]. These SNPs were intercalated with at least one previously identified and confirmed (validated) SNP to represent positional candidate genes from NCBI Build 35 (120 genes). When possible, coding SNPs, SNPs that altered a splice site or that were contained within putative regulatory regions of multi-species sequence conservation (chimp, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, Fugu, zebrafish) were selected for genotyping. If the gene was greater than 100 kb in size, multiple SNPs were selected using the same criteria. Additionally, SNPs were selected from regions that do not contain annotated genes at an average SNP to SNP distance of 100 kb, while taking into account regions of multi-species sequence conservation. Using these criteria, 231 intragenic and 226 intergenic SNPs were selected for genotype analysis within the chromosome 1q linkage region with an average spacing of 66 kb. Twenty-seven genes contained validated coding SNPs with allele frequencies >5%; twenty-two genes contained synonymous SNPs with allele frequencies >5%; eleven SNPs are found within untranslated regions (5' or 3' UTR); and one hundred and seventy-one intronic SNPs were selected, the reference allele is conserved within fifty-five of these (Additional files, Table 1 ). SNP genotyping A total of 457 SNPs were genotyped at two genotyping facilities. 384 SNPs were genotyped at the University of Washington through a grant from SeattleSNPs (see Availability and requirements section for URL). Genotyping in the GENECARD sample was performed by SeattleSNPs using the Illumina BeadStation 500 G SNP genotyping system (Illumina, San Diego, California, United States). Each Sentrix Array generates 384 genotypes for 96 individuals; within each individual array experiment, four samples purchased from Coriell were included as quality control samples. The Coriell samples were of Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) (Caucasian) origin, Asian and Hispanic ethnicity and were used for gender checking and to assess sample quality. In addition, one sample per plate was duplicated for internal quality control. These samples were used to identify possible sample plating errors and genotype calling inconsistencies. Twenty-two SNPs did not cluster well and were not called. The call rate for the remaining 362 SNPs was 99.8%. One replicate error was identified in SNP rs2370025, all other SNPs yielded greater than 99.999% concordance among the replicates. Ninety-five additional inter- and intragenic SNPs were assayed at the Center for Human Genetics using Taqman allelic discrimination assays. A total of 15 quality control samples – composed of six reference genotype controls in duplicate, two CEPH pedigree individuals, and one no-template sample – were included in each quadrant of the 384-well plate. SNPs that showed mismatches on quality-control samples were reviewed by an independent genotyping supervisor for potential genotyping errors. All SNPs examined were successfully genotyped for 95% or more of the individuals in the study. Error rate estimates for SNPs meeting the quality control benchmarks were determined to be less than 0.2%. Statistical analysis All SNPs were tested for deviations (p ≤ 0.0001) from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the affected and unaffected race-stratified groups. Two SNPs deviated from HWE in the peak-wide association study, rs1503122 (cases) and rs438781 (cases and controls). Neither of these SNPs was statistically significant in our association analysis. Interestingly, rs438781 lies within a reported copy number polymorphism, which is most likely the cause of the disequilibrium. In CATHGEN, one SNP, rs9427746, significantly deviated from HWE (p < 0.0001) in the Caucasian control group. This deviation was neither due to mixed racial backgrounds as all of the samples were from Caucasian origin, nor was it due to assay dropout as all of our controls are randomly interspersed with our cases in the 384 well plates. This deviation is either a significant departure representing an association or due to random chance. Linkage disequilibrium between pairs of SNPs was assessed using the Graphical Overview of Linkage Disequilibrium package [ 35 ] and displayed using Haploview [ 36 ]. In the initial screen, two-point linkage using a dominant and recessive model was performed using Fastlink [ 37 , 38 ] and Homog [ 39 ] and family-based association was tested using the Association in the Presence of Linkage (APL) test [ 40 ]. We analyzed the GENECARD families together regardless of race because these families formed the basis of the original linkage evidence. We chose to use the APL test for family based association because this test incorporates data from affected sibling pairs with available parental data and unaffected siblings in the analyses, effectively using all available information in the GENECARD families. The APL software infers missing parental genotypes, appropriately accounts for the non-independence of affected siblings and calculates a robust estimate of the variance. APL results from markers with variance estimates of less than five are viewed as less reliable [ 41 ]. A single SNP in TROVE2 was significant in our original screen with a variance less than five and did not replicate. In addition to APL, family-based association of FAM5C SNPs was performed using the Pedigree Disequilibrium Test (PDT) [ 42 , 43 ]. We employed this additional test at the gene level in order to obtain the most information about each polymorphism. The PDT test uses related trios and discordant sibships from extended pedigrees and like other family-based association tests is robust to population stratification. In order to determine if replicated SNPs could account for the MI linkage signal we employed Linkage and Association Modeling in Pedigrees (LAMP). LAMP estimates the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between a candidate SNP and the putative disease locus through joint modeling of linkage and association [ 44 , 45 ]. Allelic association in the CATHGEN MI cases and controls was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression modeling adjusted for sex, and known CAD risk factors (history of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, body mass index, history of dyslipidemia, and smoking history) as covariates. These adjustments could hypothetically allow us to control for competing genetic pathways that are independent risk factors for CAD, thereby allowing us to detect a separate CAD genetic effect. SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, United States) was used for statistical analysis. FAM5C sequencing To identify novel SNPs within seven regions of multi-species sequence conservation localized to the last intron of FAM5C (see Additional files, Figure 1 , arrows), PCR amplicons were generated using standard conditions and sequenced using ABI Big Dye v3.1 and an ABI 3730 automated sequencer (primers available upon request). Sequencing data were analyzed using Sequencher software (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States).

From each of the selected paraffin blocks three sections of 4 μm thick were cut and mounted on positively charged slides (Biogenex Corp, California, USA) for immunohistochemical staining. Reagents Monoclonal antibodies against mdm2, p27 Kip1 and bcl-2 were used. These antibodies recognized their corresponding proteins in paraffin-embedded sections. Monoclonal IgG-Kappa antibody against mdm2 was purchased from (Zymed Laboratories Inc., USA). It recognizes epitope located within the amino acid 26–169 of the human mdm2 protein. While monoclonal antibody against p27 Kip1 was purchased from (DAKO Corporation, USA) and monoclonal antibody against bcl-2 was purchased from (Zymed Laboratories Inc., USA). A streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase staining system was used for immuno-detection.

Rehydration of slides was performed by immersing slides in descending alcohol concentrations and then washed in distilled water. The sections were rinsed in two washes of phosphate-buffered saline for 5 minutes each (PBS; pH 7.4). For staining with mdm2 antibody, the sections were microwave antigen retrieved with citrate buffer solution (pH 4.8 for 15 minutes). P27 Kip-1 and bcl-2 antibodies required antigen retrieval by microwave processing in 0.2 M glycine buffer (Glyca, pH 6.2 ± 0.2, for 15 min.). Sections were again rinsed in two washes of PBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in water. The primary antibodies anti-mdm2, anti-p27 Kip-1 , and anti-bcl-2 were applied and the slides were incubated in a humid chamber overnight at room temperature. The sections were then washed in PBS. The secondary (Link) antibody (Biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, dilution 1:25) was then applied and the slides were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature.

      "{'pmcid': 'PMC3145824', 'abstract': 'Notch signaling is often and aberrantly activated by hypoxia during tumor progression; however, the exact pathological role of hypoxia-induced Notch signaling in tumor metastasis is as yet poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to define the mechanism of Notch ligand activation by hypoxia in both primary tumor and bone stromal cells in the metastatic niche and to clarify their roles in tumor progression. We have analyzed the expression profiles of various Notch liagnds in 779 breast cancer patients in GEO database and found that the expression of Jagged2 among all five ligands is most significantly correlated with the overall- and metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients. The results of our immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for Jagged2 in 61 clinical samples also revealed that both Jagged2 and Notch signaling were strongly up-regulated at the hypoxic invasive front.

The tetracycline-inducible system T-Rex (Invitrogen) was used to create a cell line with inducible NICD expression. First, the Myc-NICD cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA5/TO (Invitrogen). The human breast cancer cell line MDA231BoM was transfected with pcDNA6/TR encoding the Tet repressor, and a stable cell line (MDA231BoM/Tet) was generated. Then, the pcDNA5/TO/Myc-NICD expression plasmid was stably transfected into the MDA231BoM/Tet cell, and the resultant clones were designated as MDA231BoM Tet-Myc-NICD. To generate the Jagged2 reporter plasmid, the promoter of Jagged2 (from +15 to −1,352 bp) was amplified by PCR and the product was cloned into the PGL3-basic plasmid. The resultant clones were designated as PGL3-Jagged2. pCDNA3-Jagged2-myc was a kind gift from Dr Sisodia (University of Chicago) and Jagged2 sequence was sub cloned into pSin-EF2-Pur vector between EcoRI and SpeI sites.

Human breast cancer tissue array was purchased from Biomax (BR1503). The sections from paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were deparaffinized and antigens were retrieved by heating the slides in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) at 85 °C for 30min. The slides were treated with 3% H 2 O 2 and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-NICD rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; Abcam 8387 lot#329981 .), anti-Jagged1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Jagged2 goat polyclonal antibody (1:200; R&D Systems, Inc.), anti-DLL1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100; R&D Systems, Inc.), anti-DLL3 goat polyclonal antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-DLL4 rabbit polyclonal antibody(1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-glut1 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-CA9 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100; R&D Systems, Inc.). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies and visualized using Envision-plus kit (Dako Corp.) or ABC staining system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Results of the immunohistochemistry were judged based on the intensity of staining, comparing the tumor cells and the normal glands on the same slide. Grading of the NICD expression levels was done by two independent persons without prior knowledge of the patient data.

      "{'pmcid': 'PMC3174812', 'abstract': 'The principal visual cue to self-motion (egomotion) is optic flow, which is specified in terms of local 2D velocities in the retinal image without reference to depth cues. However, in general, points near the center of expansion of natural flow fields are distant, whereas those in the periphery are closer, creating gradients of horizontal binocular disparity. To assess whether the brain combines disparity gradients with optic flow when encoding egomotion, stereoscopic gradients were applied to expanding dot patterns presented to observers during functional MRI scanning. The gradients were radially symmetrical, disparity changing as a function of eccentricity. The depth cues were either consistent with egomotion (peripheral dots perceived as near and central dots perceived as far) or inconsistent (the reverse gradient, central dots near, peripheral dots far). The BOLD activity generated by these stimuli was compared in a range of predefined visual regions in 13 participants with good stereoacuity. Visual area V6, in the parieto-occipital sulcus, showed a unique pattern of results, responding well to all optic flow patterns but much more strongly when they were paired with consistent rather than inconsistent or zero-disparity gradients. Of the other areas examined, a region of the precuneus and parietoinsular vestibular cortex also differentiate between consistent and inconsistent gradients, but with weak or suppressive responses. V3A, V7, MT, and ventral intraparietal area responded more strongly in the presence of a depth gradient but were indifferent to its depth-flow congruence. The results suggest that depth and flow cues are integrated in V6 to improve estimation of egomotion.', 'method': \"MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants. Fifteen healthy human volunteers took part in the study. They were screened for normal stereoacuity before being invited to participate. Two were later excluded because of poor binocular fusion during scanning. Therefore, data from 13 participants (10 female; mean age 27 yr) were included in the analysis. All participants were scanned for the main experiment, 12/13 for retinotopic mapping and egomotion-compatible optic flow areas localizers, and 10/13 for MT/MST localizers (the missing localizer scans were due to unavailability of participants for rescanning). All participants were screened according to standard procedures, and written informed consent was obtained. The project was approved by the Royal Holloway ethics committee. Data acquisition. MRI images were obtained with a 3-Tesla Siemens Magnetom Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and a custom-designed eight-channel posterior array (PA) head coil designed for imaging posterior regions of the brain (Stark Contrast, Erlangen, Germany). Scanning was conducted over at least two sessions on different days. In one session, the data for the main experiment were acquired; in the others, functional data for the localizers and a 3D, T1-weighted anatomical scan (modified driven equilibrium Fourier transform, MDEFT; 160 × 256 × 256 resolution; 1-mm isotropic voxels; Deichmann et al. 2004 ) were acquired. This anatomical image, which alone was acquired with a standard Siemens head array coil, was used as a reference to which all the functional images obtained with the PA coil were coregistered. Functional data acquisition employed a standard gradient echoplanar sequence (main experiment and egomotion-sensitive area localizer: repetition time T R = 2.5 s, 35 contiguous axial slices, interleaved acquisition order, 3-mm isotropic voxels, T E = 31 ms; retinotopic mapping and MT/MST localizer: same parameters, except T R = 2 s, 28 slices). Each scan run lasted 6 min 40 s for the main experiment, 8 min 56 s for retinotopic mapping, 4 min 47 s for egomotion-compatible optic flow areas, and 5 min 5 s for MT/MST localizers. For coregistration purposes (see Data analysis ), at the beginning of each scanning session, we acquired two single-volume echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences that had the same position parameters as the experimental runs: one (BC-EPI) using the scanner's integral whole body coil (BC) to give uniform contrast, and another (PA-EPI), immediately after, acquired with the PA coil. Within each scanning session, a T1-weighted anatomical scan (MP-RAGE, Siemens; 1 × 1 × 1 mm; field of view: 256 × 256) was also acquired to assist with coregistration of the functional data to the MDEFT scan. Stimuli and procedure. The stimuli for the main experiment were viewed via binocular LCD goggles (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) that were adjusted to match each participant's interocular distance. The images subtended 30 × 23 degree visual angle and had a resolution of 800 × 600 pixels. The stimuli consisted of 600 moving white dots on a dark background. Each dot subtended 16-min arc diameter, and each eye's display was updated at 30 Hz. The dots, which were initially randomly located, formed a circular patch of 23-degree diameter. Dot directions were arranged to produce radial motion away from the center of the patch (expansion, simulating forward motion of the observer), with dot speed increasing as a linear function of eccentricity (min = 1.15 degree/s; max = 9.23 degree/s). A central fixation cross was provided, and participants were instructed to maintain fixation at all times. The dots had a radial gradient of horizontal disparity that was centered at the fixation plane and spanned ±52-min arc disparity. There were three disparity-gradient conditions: 1 ) consistent disparity, 2 ) inconsistent disparity, and 3 ) zero disparity. In the consistent condition, horizontal disparity changed linearly with eccentricity in all directions from the center. Dots near the center of the display had the largest uncrossed disparity and were perceived as distant, whereas dots at the periphery had the largest crossed disparity and were perceived as closer to the observer, consistent with the forward self-motion indicated by the optic flow. The fixation cross appeared at a depth midway between the nearest and furthest dots. In the inconsistent condition, the disparity gradient was reversed, the perceptual result being that dots increased in distance from the observer as they moved away from the center. This is not consistent with natural self-motion. The zero disparity condition had no disparity gradient; all the dots were presented at the fixation plane. Thus the middle of the disparity range was zero for all three stimuli. Figure 1 shows sample stereopairs illustrating the consistent and inconsistent disparity gradients. Movies showing the complete, animated stimuli are provided as online supplemental material, available at the J Neurophysiology website. Fig. 1. A: diagram showing the depth structure of the 3 stimuli used in the main experiment. The arrows indicate local dot motion direction, arrow length indicates the presence of a dot speed gradient, and arrow color indicates the magnitude of horizontal binocular disparity (see key; units are min of arc). B–D : stereopairs illustrating the stereoscopic gradients that were applied to the stimuli. Each stereopair represents 1 frame of an animation in which dots moved outward from the center, simulating forward motion. When the right image is viewed by the right eye and the left by the left, the stereopair in B creates a zero gradient. That in C creates a consistent radial gradient, and D creates an inconsistent gradient. If free fused by converging the eyes, C and D will reverse. An event-related design was used for the main experiment. Participants took part in six to nine experimental runs, each lasting 6 min 40 s. Within each run, there were 48 trials (16 per condition). During each trial, a stimulus was presented for 3 s, followed by an interstimulus interval (ISI) that varied between 2 s and 8 s in steps of 1 s, approximately following a Poisson probability distribution (median 4 s). During the ISI, the screen was a uniform gray apart from the central fixation cross, which was present continuously. A central fixation task was used to ensure attention to the depth structure of the motion stimuli and to monitor successful binocular fusion and stereopsis throughout the experiment. In this task, the color of the fixation cross was randomly reselected at a rate of 2 Hz from six easily distinguished hues, and participants were instructed to maintain fixation at all times and to monitor the color of the cross. Whenever a specific color (dark blue) appeared, the task was to indicate, by pressing one of four buttons, the nature of the displayed stimulus: “hollow” (consistent), “pointy” (inconsistent), “flat” (zero disparity), or “no stimulus” (ISI). A blue cross could occur at any time except 500 ms after the beginning and before the end of a stimulus or ISI. Only runs in which participants performed the task with at least 70% accuracy for each condition were included in the analysis. The task was possible only when fixation was close to the fixation cross. Occasional saccades resulting in small fixation errors may have occurred but are unlikely to affect the results because they do not alter the stereoscopic gradients. On completion of the main scan, participants were asked whether they experienced vection (the illusory sensation that they were actually moving). All reported that they did not, at any time. This is expected when using brief presentations because vection takes time to develop. The strategy adopted was to quantify activity occurring in the main experiment within various regions of interest, some of which have previously been associated with optic flow or egomotion. These regions were identified with separate localizer scans that enabled us to demarcate their boundaries and also to avoid “double-dipping” bias when quantifying activity within them. Stimuli for the localizer scans were back projected onto a screen mounted in the rear of the scanner bore by a computer-controlled LCD projector. During the retinotopic mapping and MT/MST localizer scans, all stimuli were seen binocularly in free view via a mirror above the head coil. For retinotopic mapping, standard procedures were used ( Sereno et al. 1995 ; rotating 24-degree flickering red and green “wedge”; 8 cycles; 64 s/cycle). MT and MST were mapped using a standard procedure ( Huk et al. 2002 ) in which moving and static dots are contrasted in each hemifield. Areas V6, VIP, p2v, PIVC, and PcM were localized using egomotion-compatible optic flow as described in Cardin and Smith (2010) . Stimuli for this localizer scan were viewed via a custom monocular optical device that magnified the image, to obtain wide-field visual stimulation (60 degrees). The unstimulated eye was occluded. Mean Talairach coordinates for these regions of interest (ROIs) are reported in Table 1 , along with mean cluster sizes. Table 1.

PcM, precuneus motion area; VIP, ventral intraparietal area; CSv, cingulate sulcus visual area; PIVC, parietoinsular vestibular cortex. Data analysis: main experiment. All data were preprocessed and analyzed with BrainVoyager QX (version 2.2; Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). EPIs were corrected for head motion and slice timing and were filtered with a temporal high-pass filter of 0.01 Hz. No smoothing was applied. All functional images were aligned to the PA-EPI acquired at the beginning of the scan session. Because of the steep posterior-to-anterior intensity gradient of the EPIs acquired with the PA head coil, coregistration of these images to the anatomy is poor. Therefore, we coregistered the BC-EPI to the intrasession inhomogeneity-corrected MP-RAGE and assumed no head movements between the acquisition of this BC-EPI and the PA-EPI. All images where then transformed to the space of the reference MDEFT image, using parameters obtained from the coregistration of the two anatomical scans. Coregistration accuracy was checked visually. Analysis was conducted by fitting a general linear model with regressors representing the three stimulus categories and four button presses. For every condition, each event was modeled as a boxcar with 3 s (stimuli) and 0.5 s (button presses) duration, convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function, and entered into a multiple-regression analysis to generate parameter estimates for each regressor at every voxel. Six movement parameters were derived from the realignment of the images and were also included in the model. The first three volumes of each run were discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects. Effect sizes (β values) for the three experimental conditions were extracted for each independently defined ROI by averaging across all voxels in the ROI. The results were normalized, to account for overall amplitude differences across participants, by expressing each activation in a given ROI as a proportion of the largest activation. This was done independently for each ROI. Finally, the results were averaged across participants. Data analysis: ROI definitions. Areas V6, VIP, p2v, PIVC, and PcM were defined as all contiguous voxels that were more active with a single pattern of expansion-contraction and rotation (egomotion compatible), than with nine simultaneous smaller patterns (egomotion incompatible) in the parieto-occipital sulcus (V6), the intraparietal sulcus (VIP), the junction of the intraparietal sulcus and the postcentral sulcus (p2v), the region of the precuneus dorsal to the ascending arm of the cingulated sulcus (PcM), and the posterior region of the insula, putatively the PIVC. Area V6 was successfully defined in 22/24 hemispheres, VIP in 14/24, p2v in 16/24, CSv in 20/24, PcM in 17/24, and PIVC in 19/24. The method is described in detail in our earlier work ( Cardin and Smith 2010 ). MST was defined as all contiguous voxels within MT+ that were significantly active during ipsilateral motion stimulation. MT was defined as all contiguous active voxels that were active during contralateral but not ipsilateral stimulation, with the proviso that any MT voxels situated further anterior than the median value of the MST ROI on the horizontal (axial) plane were removed from the MT ROI. MT and MST were successfully defined in all the scanned hemispheres ( n = 20). Retinotopic data were analyzed conventionally. ROIs (visual areas V1-V7) were drawn by eye on the basis of boundaries formed by phase reversals, viewed on a flattened version of each participant's reference anatomy. V3B was defined according to the original criteria of Smith et al. (1998) and corresponds to LO1 of Larsson and Heeger (2006) . Retinotopic areas were successfully defined in all the scanned hemispheres ( n = 24).\", 'subjects': None}\n",

Subjects had bone density (lumbar spine (L 2 -L 4 ) and femoral neck BMD), inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6, PGE 2 ), hormone concentrations (estrogen, osteocalcin, 1, 25 Vit D, CTX, PTH, CT), blood ions (Ca 2+ , phosphorus, and fatty acid composition of neutrophil extracts) measured at baseline, the end of week 12 (after 24 hours of recovery), and the end of week 24 (after 24 hours of recovery). The women were sedentary, in good health, at least 8 years past-menopause, and taking no medications. Preliminary screening included a medical history, physical examination, and a Bruce treadmill test [ 34 ]. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups: exercise + supplement (E+S, n = 21), exercise only (E, n = 20), supplement only (S, n = 20), and control (Con, n = 18) groups. Leisure, household, and occupational activity was estimated with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly Questionnaire [ 35 ] (Table 1 ).

Values are mean ± SD Oral omega-3 The E+S and S groups were supplemented with N-3 PUFA capsules (Viva Omega-3 fish oil, Manufactured by: Viva Pharmaceutical Inc, Richmond B.C. V6V 1K8, Canada), containing 180 mg EPA and 120 mg Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), to supply a total of 1000 mg/day [ 12 ] of N-3 PUFAs over 24 weeks. The degree of compliance with N-3 PUFA supplements, as determined by pill counts, was 96 ± 9%. Also, the incorporation of EPA and DHA into the cell membranes of neutrophils was measured. Information was collected from each individual by trained interviewers in face to face interviews based on a structured and previously validated questionnaire that included the following: socio-demographic data; years since menopause; physical activities, including hours spent sitting, standing, walking, sports, and leisure activities; medications; smoking and drinking alcohol; and other factors that may have possible confounding effects on N-3 PUFA consumption and metabolism of bone and lipid [ 36 ]. All subjects were requested to consume their usual diet throughout the period of study. A detailed diary of all types and household measures of food and drinks consumed, including brand names, was kept for baseline, week 12 and week 24 [ 37 ]. Dietary intakes did not alter more than would be expected over the 24 weeks of the study (Table 2 ). Daily intakes of calcium, vitamin D, carbohydrates, lipids, saturated fatty acid, mono-unsaturated fatty acid, PUFA, proteins and total energy were calculated from the daily record by the dietitian on the basis of the fifth revision of the standard tables of food composition in Japan [ 36 ]. Information on use of medications and drugs was also obtained through standard and self-reported questionnaires in accordance to the researchers' recommendations [ 12 ].

Values are mean ± SD Exercise program In the first 12 weeks of the study, subjects in E+S and E groups walked or jogged on a treadmill 25-30 min·day -1 , 3-4 days·week -1 , at 45-55% of their individually determined HR max . As their exercise tolerance improved, the intensity and duration of exercise training in the second 12 weeks of the study were increased to 40-45 min·day -1 , 4-6 days·week -1 ; at an intensity of 55-65% of HR max . Adherence to the exercise prescription was documented through the use of Polar heart rate monitors, and subjects received feedback if training intensities were either too high or low in comparison with desirable intensities. Attendance was taken at each exercise session to monitor compliance with the program. Subjects were contacted if an exercise session was missed. In those women who completed the interventions, there was > 95% compliance for attendance at the exercise sessions. Nine subjects (E + S group, n = 1; E group, n = 2; S group, n = 2; Con group, n = 4) could not complete the study protocol and were excluded from the study. All exercise sessions began between 0600 and 0800 h. The S and Con group subjects were instructed to maintain their current physical activity levels during the study [ 12 ]. Measurements Blood sampling and assays Following a 12-hour overnight fast, blood samples were taken between 0700-0800 h and collected from an antecubital vein. Samples were taken at baseline, 12 and 24 wks. Standard procedures for blood handling and processing were followed. All samples were taken 24 h after the last exercise bout. Blood samples were analyzed for serum TNF-α, IL-6, PGE 2 , estrogen, osteocalcin, 1, 25- Vit D, CTX, PTH, CT, Ca 2+ , phosphorus, and fatty acid composition of neutrophil extracts. Serum IL-6 and TNF-α measurements were assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit from Biosource (Nivelles, Belgium). PGE 2 was determined using competitive enzyme immunoassay (PGE 2 EIA kit- Monoclonal [solid plate], Ceyman-Germany). Serum estrogen levels were detected through a chemiluminescent method (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) using an automatic immunoanalyzer. Circulating osteocalcin was measured using a previously developed radioimmunoassay (RIA). Serum 1, 25- Vit D was measured by a radioreceptor assay. Serum CTX was assessed using Serum Cross Laps One-Step ELISA (Osteometer BioTech, Herlev, Denmark). Serum PTH levels were measured through an electrochemiluminescent method, using Elecsys Systems/Modular analytics E170 (catalog number, 11972103; Roche Diagnostics). CT was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a polyclonal antiserum directed against the carboxyterminus. The antibodies were produced in rabbits against human CT, using a calcitonin kit (CIS Bio International ORIS groups, France). Serum calcium and phosphorus levels were measured by standard automated laboratory techniques. Incorporation of EPA and DHA into the cell membranes of neutrophils was analyzed using gas chromatography using known standards [ 12 , 37 ]. Bone measurements BMD measurements were made at the anterior-posterior lumbar spine (L 2 -L 4 ) and the non-dominant proximal femur, including femoral neck, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Norland XR36; Norland, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA). The coefficients of variation (CV) for the L 2 -L 4 and femoral neck were 1.21% and 1.54% respectively. Statistical analysis Group differences were determined using a one way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) for repeated measures, for continuous variables. If the main effects F -ratio was significant, differences among groups were subsequently identified using a Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. Partial correlation and mixed model regression coefficients were used to evaluate the association between the variables studied. The statistical software program SPSS (SPSS Co, Chicago IL, version 17) for windows was used for data analysis. All statistical tests were performed and considered significant at a P ≤ 0.05.\", 'subjects': None}\n"
